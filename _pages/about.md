About Me
I am a 2nd-year PhD student in Machine Learning at the Gatsby Unit, University College London supervised by Professor Peter Orbanz. I work on causal machine learning, machine learning under symmetry and aspects of probabilistic machine learning such as Gaussian processes and variational inference. Most recently, I have been focussed on understanding how local symmetries can be leveraged in causal models to improve the quality and robustness of inference. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I earned a master’s degree in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning from University College London (2021), a master’s degree in Economics at University College London (2016), and an undergraduate degree in Economics and International Relations from the University of Birmingham. Between 2016-2020 I worked for 4 years as an econometrician in PwC's Economics team in London.
