title: Quantifying the effect of CEO contract incentives on Share Buybacks and Investment
excerpt: I was PwCs lead econometrician for two projects commissioned to PwC in 2018 and 2020 (in collaboration with [Professor Alex Edmans](https://alexedmans.com) at London Business School) by the UK Government's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) on executive pay, share buybacks and investment in the UK. [The first project](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d2f0e83e5274a14e9f6bbe5/share-repurchases-executive-pay-investment.pdf) aimed to identify whether Earnings Per Share (EPS) targets in CEO contracts encouraged firms to undertake share buybacks to artificially hit EPS targets and/or reduce investment, using a proprietary dataset of FTSE350 companies. To remove the effect of potential confounders, we used various identification strategies -  most notably a Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design where we tested whether firms with EPS just below target before repuchasing was a significant predictor of subsequent share buybacks (and reduced investment). [The subsequent study](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/60b8d8628fa8f57cf05a64c6/exec-pay-investment-research-report.pdf) focussed more closely on the direct link between CEO contract targets and investment levels, and used similar identification and estimation techniques. <br/><img src='/images/illustrative_discontinuity_plot.png'> <br/><img src='/images/threshold_comparisons.png' width = '400' height = '500'>
