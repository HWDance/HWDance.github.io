title: Quantifying the effect of CEO contract incentives on Share Buybacks and Investment
excerpt: I was the lead econometrician for two projects commissioned in 2018 and 2020 by the UK Government's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) on executive pay, share buybacks and investment in the UK. [The first project](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d2f0e83e5274a14e9f6bbe5/share-repurchases-executive-pay-investment.pdf) aimed to quantify the extent to which Earnings Per Share (EPS) targets in CEO contracts encouraged firms to undertake share buybacks to artificially hit EPS targets, and any effect on investment, using a proprietary dataset of FTSE350 companies. To remove the effect of potential confounders, we implemented various econometric models, and most notably a Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design whereby we tested whether having an EPS value just below a target before undertaking share buybacks was a significant predictor of increased share buybacks (and reduced investment). [The second project](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/60b8d8628fa8f57cf05a64c6/exec-pay-investment-research-report.pdf) was a follow on study which focussed more closely on the direct link between CEO contract targets and investment levels, and used similar estimation techniques. <br/><img src='/images/threshold_comparisons.png'>
