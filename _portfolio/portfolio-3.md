title: Marketing effectiveness for a global airline 
excerpt: Between 2018-2020 we collaborated with [Marketscience](https://market.science) to optimise the marketing allocation of a leading international airline. We used likelihood-based causal discovery methods to infer the causal relationships between marketing channels, and used non-stationary time-varying parameter models to identify both long-term and short-term marketing effects on sales.
