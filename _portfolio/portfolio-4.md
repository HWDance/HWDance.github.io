title: Marketing effectiveness for a global airline 
excerpt: Between 2018-2020 we collaborated with [Marketscience](https://market.science) to optimise the marketing allocation of a leading international airline. We used likelihood-based causal discovery methods to infer causal relationships between marketing channels, identify confounders and mediators, and therefore enable sales attribution. We also used non-stationary time-varying parameter models in order to more reliably identify both long-term and short-term marketing effects on sales, by comparison to typical adstock multiplier approaches.
