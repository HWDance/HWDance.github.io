title: Nowcasting UK GDP growth
excerpt: Between 2017-2020 and 2021-2022 I developed and maintained PwC's Nowcasting Model for GDP growth, which we initially [launched](https://www.pwc.co.uk/economic-services/ukeo/pwcukeo-section4-nowcasting-july-2017.pdf) in July 2017.  The main idea behind this project was to leverage higher frequency (i.e. daily-monthly) economic indicators to provide an early prediction of lower frequency (i.e. quarterly) GDP growth releases by the ONS. The first model we developed used standard high-dimensional linear regression methods with elastic net penalties. In later iterations, I developed and implemented high-dimensional Bayesian regression models with novel shrinkage priors and a bespoke Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. This  enabled us to more reliably adapt to the inherent sparsity in the data, incorporate in prior knowledge about key economic relationships, and quantify uncertainty around point estimates. Our forecasts were on average within 0.1% of the predicted quarterly GDP growth in out of sample testing.
