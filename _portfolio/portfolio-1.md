title: "PwC Project: Estimating the Effect Effect of SME lending on growth"
excerpt: "In 2019 I was the lead econometrician on a project for one of the largest 15 global retail banks. The project was aimed at quantifying the effect of green lending products for Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) on subsequent revenue growth. Since the client could only provide data on firms that took part in their scheme, a key challenge was identifying and selecting an appropriate control group. To do this, we combined the client's data with our own database of SMEs, and used non-parametric propensity score caliper matching to select the control group based on a high-dimensional set of potential confounders. We found statistically significant and positive effects of SME lending on firm growth, and our project results featured in the client's Annual Sustainability Review. <br/><img src='/images/matching.png' width = '80' height = '80'> <br/><img src='/images/prop_scores.png'>"
